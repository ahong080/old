    <h2 class="article-title">How I prepared for Step 1 of the USMLE</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="resources-i-recommend">Resources I recommend</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First Aid 2013</li>
  <li>USMLE-Rx qbank (hereby referred to as “rx”)</li>
  <li>USMLE World qbank (hereby referred to as “uworld”)</li>
  <li>Picmonic</li>
  <li>Pathoma</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="resources-i-do-not-recommend">Resources I DO NOT recommend</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Microbio made ridiculously simple – I didn’t like the text-heavy format. I could have just read First Aid, used flashcards, and done questions.</li>
  <li>Emory-specific: every module textbook except for Lily cardiology (First Aid and Wikipedia are sufficient to understand pathophysiology) are a waste of money</li>
  <li>Goljan is too dense and comprehensive; use Pathoma instead</li>
  <li>Robbins &amp; Cotran is even thicker than Goljan!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scheduling-emory-centric">Scheduling (Emory-centric)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>M2 ended on November 22nd, 2013.</li>
  <li>I took Step 1 on January 27th, 2014.</li>
  <li>This gave me 65 days (9 weeks, 2 days) to prepare.</li>
  <li>I took 8 days off to travel to California for a conference, see my family for the holidays, etc. This left me with 57 days (8 weeks, 1 day) to prepare.</li>
  <li>Realistically, I studied 5 to 6 full days per week, and used 8 weeks. This was a perfect amount of time. Less would be insufficient, and more would leave me burnt out.</li>
  <li>To maintain balance and optimize long-term focus, I recommend regularly exercising, sleeping 6-8 hours a night, and maintaining some social activity.</li>
  <li>I divided my studying into <em>two phases</em>: learning and question banks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="phase-1--learning-phase">Phase 1 – Learning phase</h2>
<ul>
  <li>33 days (4 weeks, 5 days), from 11/23/2013 to 1/5/2014.</li>
  <li>I reviewed First Aid 2013 cover to cover for a second time. This was not the first time, because I used First Aid 2013 as the framework from which I chose topics to focus my studies on during the modules. I chose to ignore our provided syllabi in lieu of material that was guaranteed to be high yield. I did not fail any module exams, and scored well on NBME exams. I highly recommend this. If I could go back, I would skip more lectures, study more First Aid, and do Rx or Firecracker as I went through M1 and M2.</li>
  <li>Each section took 2-4 days to complete.</li>
  <li>I read the material, then did module-specific Rx questions.</li>
  <li>I chose to learn with Rx (not UWorld) because Rx ties directly to First Aid.</li>
  <li>I only finished 40% of Rx; the goal was the reinforce learning of concepts via vignettes, not completion.</li>
  <li>My strongest sections: GI, pulmonology, psych.</li>
  <li>My weakest sections: microbiology, pharmacology, EBM (because we learned it so long ago), cardiology, neurology.</li>
  <li>I wish I spent less time on Learning and more time on QBanks</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="phase-2--qbanks-phase">Phase 2 – QBanks phase</h2>
<ul>
  <li>22 days (3 weeks, 1 day), from 1/6/2014 to 1/27/2014.</li>
  <li>Every day, I did UWorld blocks of 46 questions on all random (every topic in First Aid) in tutorial mode.</li>
  <li>I heavily annotated First Aid with colored pens and sticky notes.</li>
  <li>I left a dot next to the topic in First Aid so I would know which topics were heavily tested.</li>
  <li>The most common topics on UWorld were EBM, HIV, hepatitis, antiviral drugs, diabetes, psych drug side effects, P450 modulators, alpha and beta blockers, heart murmurs, IBD, … will update list later.</li>
  <li>I eventually switched from tutorial to timed, do a block or two, then review the answers later.</li>
  <li>At first, it took me a day (8 hours of studying) to answer and review two 46-question blocks. I averaged ~60%.</li>
  <li>I improved my speed to four 46-question blocks (if I focused hard). My average score improved to &gt;70%.</li>
  <li>I finished all 2200+ UWorld questions a few days before I sat for Step 1. I then reviewed the questions I got wrong. I highly recommend this. Completion of a qbank builds confidence, even if retention is not 100%.</li>
  <li>I also took both UWorld diagnostic exams (blocks of 4 questions that give you a representative score). I am unsure if this was useful.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="test-day">Test day</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I took Step 1 at a ProMetric center 20 minutes east of Atlanta, in Tucker, GA. I chose this location because I assumed a suburban area would have less traffic and easier parking than downtown Atlanta.</li>
  <li>I took a practice NBME exam at the test center a few days before Step 1. This helped me get a feel for the parking, building layout, security process, and computer system layout. I highly recommend this.</li>
  <li>On test day, I brought water, coffee, banana bread graciously baked by an M3 friend, and mixed nuts with dried fruits.</li>
  <li>I took two blocks of 46 questions, then a 5-10 minute break. I paced my caffeine intake and maintained hydration.</li>
  <li>I always finished every medical school exam and qbank block with time to spare, so I never worried about pacing. I usually finished a 46-question 60-minute block in about 45 minutes.</li>
  <li>No matter how well-prepared, you will become mentally fatigued after the 5th straight block of 46 questions. Slow down, stretch, take deep breaths, and stay focused.</li>
  <li>Answer every single question; guessing carries no penalty.</li>
</ul>
