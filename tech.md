I work at [Takeda Ventures, Inc.](http://takedaventures.com), an early-stage venture capital firm, with Senior Partner [David Shaywitz, MD, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-shaywitz-md-phd-232a237/).

We are interested in data science and technology approaches that contribute to drug discovery & development, clinical trials, and healthcare delivery.

If you are working on something related to the above, please contact me (see my homepage for info). We'd like to see if we can help.

In 2014 I co-founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance with clinical pilots. In 2016 Forge merged with Sling Health, a biomedical technology incubator with a national presence ([see blog post](http://erikreinertsen.com/forge-merger-sling-health/)).

At Emory I created an elective course for medical students on [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/papers/iemed.pdf) and ran it for two years.

At UCLA I founded and led a chapter of the [International Society for Pharmaceutical
Engineering](http://www.ispeucla.com/). We were the first organization to provide students with career opportunities in biotechnology and pharma.
