## Venture capital

I am a consultant at [Takeda Ventures, Inc.](http://takedaventures.com)(TVI), an early-stage venture capital firm within a large pharma company. I work with Senior Partner [David Shaywitz, MD, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-shaywitz-md-phd-232a23e/). Previously I interned at TVI.

We invest in startups that use data science and technology to discover, evaluate, or deliver impactful new treatments for patients.

Startups that are especially compelling:
+ Solve a relevant pharma problem.  
+ Are led by founders with expertise in tech and pharma.  
+ Focus on pragmatic implementation (vs tech development).  

Categories of interest include:
+ Digital biology: target identification, lead generation, imaging.  
+ Clinical evidence: siteless trials, data fusion, phenotyping.  
+ Patient engagement: empowerment, education, digital therapeutics.  

If you are a founder, or researcher who wants to translate your work from the lab to the clinic, please get in touch!

I work with Emory DST, an initiative to catalyze data science collaborations between students, researchers, clinicians, engineers, and data scientists across Emory and Georgia Tech. We are creating a database of projects, and organizing a ''Think Tank'' event.

## Past activities

In 2014 I co-founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance with clinical pilots. In 2016 Forge merged with Sling Health, a biomedical technology incubator with a national presence ([see blog post](http://erikreinertsen.com/forge-merger-sling-health/)).

At Emory I created an elective course for medical students on [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/papers/iemed.pdf) and ran it for two years.

At UCLA I founded and led a chapter of the [International Society for Pharmaceutical
Engineering](http://www.ispeucla.com/). We were the first organization to provide students with career opportunities in biotechnology and pharma.
