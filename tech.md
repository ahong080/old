I work at [Takeda Ventures, Inc.](http://takedaventures.com), an early-stage life science venture capital firm. My supervisor is [David Shaywitz, MD, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-shaywitz-md-phd-232a237/). I source and evaluate startups that use data science and technology to develop impactful new medicines, improve clinical trials, etc.

In 2014 I co-founded [Forge](http://forgehealth.org), a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance with clinical pilots. In 2016 Forge merged with Sling Health, a biomedical technology incubator with a national presence ([see blog post](http://erikreinertsen.com/forge-merger-sling-health/)).

At Emory I created an elective course for medical students on [Innovation & Entrepreneurship in Medicine](http://erikreinertsen.com/papers/iemed.pdf) and ran it for two years.

At UCLA I founded and led a chapter of the [International Society for Pharmaceutical
Engineering](http://www.ispeucla.com/). We were the first organization to provide students with career opportunities in biotechnology and pharma.
