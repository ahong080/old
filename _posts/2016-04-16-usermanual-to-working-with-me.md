Brad Feld posted a great idea: a ["user manual to working with you"](http://www.feld.com/archives/2016/04/user-manual-working.html).

This is helpful to your mentors, mentees, colleagues, investors, etc.

The User Manual has two sets of questions. Here are my answers.

*Still in progress...*

---

## The 1st set focuses on the individual person.

> What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

I strive to be focused, organized, and direct.

> What drives you nuts?

+ **Slow communication:** we all have smartphones... there is no excuse.
+ **Buzzwords:** signals group-think or a lack of depth, e.g. "innovation center".
+ **Verbosity:** wastes time.
+ **Mandatory requirements:** describes half of my PhD... when process trumps purpose, the process has failed.
+ **Vagueness** instead of "maybe" or "sometime", just say what you mean to say.

> What are your quirks?

> What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?

+ **Responsive:** reply promptly.
+ **Concise:** say it in fewer words.
+ **Competent:** do it well.
+ **Hustle:** crush any obstacles.
+ **Clear:** no BS; say what you mean to say.
+ **Selfless:** put the team first.
+ **Quantitative:** measure what matters.
+ **Time-aware:** use agendas and respect when meetings start and end.

> What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

---

## The 2nd set focuses on how you interact with others.

> How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?

> What’s the best way to communicate with you?

+ **If we work on the same team:** Slack > email.
+ **If you are reaching out:** Twitter, which can convert to an email.
+ **Personal:** text message > Facebook.

> What’s the best way to convince you to do something?

+ Do you truly need my help, or can anyone do it?
+ Does it benefit many people +/- me, or just yourself?
+ Is the deliverable, due date, and time commitment specific and clear?
+ Do I have bandwidth right now?

> How do you like to give feedback?

Via constructive and action-oriented discussion.

Why did you do X? What did you hope to achieve? What worked well and not well? What would you do and measure next time?

> How do you like to get feedback?

The same way as I like to give feedback.

The next step is to get feedback from people you work with: 

1. Are your answers correct?
2. How can you improve?

From a friend after reading this:

> In the future I'll make sure to be slow and vague when communicating with you via your preferred method, Vine.
