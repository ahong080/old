Brad Feld posted a great idea: a ["user manual to working with you"](http://www.feld.com/archives/2016/04/user-manual-working.html).

This is helpful to your mentors, mentees, colleagues, investors, etc.

*Still in progress.*

## Who are you as a person?

> What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

I strive to be focused, organized, and direct.  
I am prideful but try to be humble and always learning.  
I am impatient.

> What drives you nuts?

+ **Slow communication** is unacceptable; we all have smartphones.  
+ **Buzzwords** signals group-think and superficial thought.  
+ **Mandatory requirements** instead of meaningful activities.  
+ **"Maybe", "sometimes", or "perhaps"** are words of the imprecise.
+ **Ellipses** are passive-aggressive and imply rather than declare.
+ **Mispelling my name**; its there in my email signature, get it right.

> What are your quirks?

I clean my house a lot. 

> What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?

+ **Responsive:** reply promptly.
+ **Concise:** say it in fewer words.
+ **Competent:** do it well.
+ **Hustle:** solve problems without excuses.
+ **Clear:** no BS; say what you mean to say.
+ **Selfless:** put the team first.
+ **Quantitative:** measure what matters.
+ **Time-aware:** use agendas and respect when time is up.

> What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

---

## How do you interact with others?

> How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?

> What’s the best way to communicate with you?

+ **If we work on the same team:** email me.
+ **If you are reaching out:** Twitter or email; be brief.
+ **Personal:** text me.

> What’s the best way to convince you to do something?

+ Do you truly need my help, or can anyone do it?
+ Does it benefit many people +/- me, or just yourself?
+ Is the deliverable, due date, and time commitment clear?
+ Do I have bandwidth right now?

> How do you like to give feedback?

I ask many questions to understand the situation. I then provide constructive, specific, and actionable input.

One of my mentors has a good approach of telling you 1) what worked well, and 2) how can you be better.

> How do you like to get feedback?

The same way as I like to give feedback.

From a colleague after reading this:

> In the future I'll make sure to be slow and vague when communicating with you via your preferred method, Vine.
