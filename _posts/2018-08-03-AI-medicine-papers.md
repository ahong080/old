To make finding these papers easier, I've reproduced the table (without N or AUC), added a few more studies, and linked to PDFs. These are good papers for biomedical researchers or clinicians who are interested in informatics, or for data scientists and engineers interested in medicine. Use this for your journal club schedule!
