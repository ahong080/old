At Georgia Tech I TA'd two semesters of computational systems biology. We covered linear algebra, differential equations, graph theory, probabilistic models, parameter estimation, and metabolomics.

Here are my teaching evaluations from [Fall 2015](/assets/ta_eval_15.pdf) and [Spring 2016](/assets/ta_eval_16.pdf).

I wrote a blog post: ["Tips for TAing"](http://erikreinertsen.com/tips-for-taing).

At Emory I helped start the [Medical Student Teaching Competition](/papers/mstc.pdf).

At UCLA I tutored undergraduate engineering students for two years.
