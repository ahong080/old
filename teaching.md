I aspire to be a great teacher of both medicine and engineering.

At Georgia Tech I TA'd two semesters of computational systems biology. We covered linear algebra, differential equations, graph theory, probabilistic models, parameter estimation, and metabolomics. Here are my teaching evaluations from [Fall 2015](/assets/ta_eval_15.pdf) and [Spring 2016](/assets/ta_eval_16.pdf).

Relevant blog posts are ["Tips for TAing"](http://erikreinertsen.com/tips-for-taing) and ["How to give a great chalk talk"](https://erikreinertsen.com/give-a-great-chalk-talk/).

At Emory I helped start the [Medical Student Teaching Competition](https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2017/08000/Encouraging_Student_Interest_in_Teaching_Through_a.34.aspx).

At UCLA I tutored undergraduate engineering students for two years.
