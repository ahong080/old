I completed my postdoctoral fellowship at the [Center for Systems Biology][csb] at Massachusetts General Hospital, [Computational Cardiovascular Research Group][ccrg] at MIT, and [Machine Learning for Health][ml4h] initiative at the Broad Institute.

My work focused on multimodal data curation, machine learning infrastructure, and clinical outcome prediction using electronic medical record data and complex physiological signals such as ECGs and invasive hemodynamic measurements.

I obtained my PhD in Biomedical Engineering and Statistics at Georgia Tech where I worked on signal processing and machine learning applied to time series data from wearable devices.

Prior to MD/PhD training, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA, after starting in computer science, and minoring in chemical engineering. I developed cellularized fibrin hydrogels for dermal wound healing, nanoparticles for imaging cells, and computational diffusion-reaction models of oxygen transport and cell growth.
