I am a postdoctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Research Laboratory of Electronics) and Massachusetts General Hospital (Cardiology Division). My advisors are [Aaron Aguirre](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/10465), [Brandon Westover](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/84202), and [Collin Stultz](http://imes.mit.edu/people/faculty/stultz-collin/). We work on deep learning to predict adverse cardiovascular events.

I did my PhD at Georgia Tech with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari), [Shamim Nemati](http://nematilab.info/people/shamim/index.html), and [Amit Shah](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#AJSHAH3). We extracted features from heart rate and accelerometer data using signal processing, classified illness from these features with machine learning, and improved performance by analyzing information during specific times, over several time scales, and between signals. Application areas included sepsis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, mental illness, and neurodegeneration.

At UCLA I studied how fibrin hydrogel composition affected fibroblast and keratinocyte behavior, imaged stem cells using gold nanoparticle labeling and microcomputed tomography, and developed computational and experimental models of oxygen transport and osteoblast growth in polymer scaffolds. My advisors were Bill Tawil and Benjamin Wu in the Department of Bioengineering.
