I completed postdoctoral training at Mass General, MIT, and the Broad Institute where I was advised by [Aaron Aguirre][aa], [Collin Stultz][cs], and [Puneet Batra][pb]. We developed computational approaches to stratify risk, predict outcomes, and discover phenotypes from electronic medical record data and complex physiological signals including ECGs and invasive hemodynamic measurements.

I did my PhD at Georgia Tech. I worked on signal processing and machine learning applied to time series data from wearable devices. My advisors were [Gari Clifford][gc], [Shamim Nemati][sn], and [Amit Shah][as].

Prior to MD/PhD training, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA. I developed cellularized fibrin hydrogels for dermal wound healing, nanoparticles for imaging cells, and computational diffusion-reaction models of oxygen transport and cell growth. My advisors were Bill Tawil and Benjamin Wu.

My papers are available at [Google Scholar][scholar].
