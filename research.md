I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Mass General, MIT, and the Broad Institute. My advisors are [Aaron Aguirre](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/10465), [Brandon Westover](http://cdac.mgh.harvard.edu), and [Collin Stultz](http://www.rle.mit.edu/cb/).

We develop deep learning approaches for several projects:
* Inference of diagnoses and novel outcomes from 12-lead ECGs
* Prediction of cardiac shock or arrest from ICU time series data
* Stratification of outcomes after cardiac surgical procedures

I am affiliated with several institutions:
* [Cardiovascular Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital](http://cvrc.massgeneral.org).  
* [Research Laboratory for Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.rle.mit.edu).  
* [ML4CVD, Data Sciences Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/data-sciences-platform).  
* [Healthcare Transformation Lab, Massachusetts General Hospital](http://healthcaretransformation.org); I advise Fellows on clinical innovation projects that leverage informatics, machine learning, and wearable sensors. 
* [Clinical Data Animation Center, Massachusetts General Hospital](http://cdac.mgh.harvard.edu).  

I did my PhD at Georgia Tech. I worked on signal processing and machine learning applied to time series data from wearable devices. My advisors were [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari), [Shamim Nemati](http://nematilab.info/people/shamim/index.html), and [Amit Shah](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#AJSHAH3).

Prior to my MD/PhD training, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA. I developed cellularized fibrin hydrogels for dermal wound healing, nanoparticles for imaging cells, and computational diffusion-reaction models of oxygen transport and cell growth. My advisors were Bill Tawil and Benjamin Wu.
