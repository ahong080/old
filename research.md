I am interested in developing machine learning algorithms, computational infrastructure, and data exploration tools that improve biomedical research and patient care.

I did my PhD in the [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info). We extracted features from heart rate and accelerometer data using signal processing, estimated illness from these features with machine learning, and improved performance by analyzing information during specific times, over several time scales, and between signals.

Application areas included sepsis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, mental illness, and neurodegenerative disease.

We patented an algorithm to monitor PTSD via heart rate variability. It was licensed to a company and is being commercialized.

My papers are available via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=APy8nq4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
