I did my PhD in the [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari). We used machine learning, statistics, and information theory to show classification of illness using features from heart rate and accelerometer data is improved by considering information during specific times, over several time scales, and between signals.

We developed, patented, and [licensed](http://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/medibio-s-noninvasive-objective-ptsd-diagnostic-correct-80-time) an algorithm to monitor PTSD via cardiovascular stress.

My papers are available via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=APy8nq4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
