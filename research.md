I did my PhD in the [Clifford Lab](http://gdclifford.info). We extracted features from heart rate and accelerometer data using signal processing, estimated illness from these features with machine learning, and improved performance by analyzing information during specific times, over several time scales, and between signals.

Application areas included heart failure, atrial fibrillation, sepsis, mental illness, and neurodegenerative disease.

We patented an algorithm to monitor PTSD via cardiovascular stress. It is now being commercialized.
