I am a postdoctoral research fellow at MGH and MIT. My advisors are [Aaron Aguirre](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/10465) (MGH Cardiology), [Brandon Westover](http://cdac.mgh.harvard.edu) (MGH Neurology), and [Collin Stultz](http://www.rle.mit.edu/cb/) (MIT RLE, EECS, CSAIL, HST, and MGH Cardiology).

We build machine learning algorithms to read ECGs, predict cardiovascular emergencies from physiological time series data, and phenotype shock.

I am also affiliated with the [Healthcare Transformation Lab](http://healthcaretransformation.org) at MGH, which was created to improve the experience and value of health care by inspiring collaborative innovation and leveraging novel technologies.

I did my PhD at Georgia Tech. My thesis research focused on signal processing and machine learning on time series data from wearable devices. My advisors were [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari), [Shamim Nemati](http://nematilab.info/people/shamim/index.html), and [Amit Shah](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#AJSHAH3).

Prior to my MD/PhD training, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA. In the lab I developed cellularized fibrin hydrogels for dermal wound healing, nanoparticles for imaging cells, and computational diffusion-reaction models of oxygen transport and cell growth. My advisors were Bill Tawil and Benjamin Wu.

My papers are available at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=APy8nq4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
