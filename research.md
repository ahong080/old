I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Mass General and MIT. My advisors are [Aaron Aguirre][aa], [Brandon Westover][bw], and [Collin Stultz][cs].

We develop deep learning approaches for several projects:
* Inference of diagnoses and novel outcomes from 12-lead ECGs
* Prediction of cardiac shock or arrest from ICU time series data
* Stratification of outcomes after cardiac surgical procedures

I am affiliated with:
* [ML4CVD, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard][broad]  
* [Research Laboratory for Electronics, MIT][rle]  
* [Center for Systems Biology, Mass General][csb]     
* [Clinical Data Animation Center, Mass General][cdac]   

I did my PhD at Georgia Tech. I worked on signal processing and machine learning applied to time series data from wearable devices. My advisors were [Gari Clifford][gc], [Shamim Nemati][sn], and [Amit Shah][as].

Prior to my MD/PhD training, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA. I developed cellularized fibrin hydrogels for dermal wound healing, nanoparticles for imaging cells, and computational diffusion-reaction models of oxygen transport and cell growth. My advisors were Bill Tawil and Benjamin Wu.

My papers are available at [Google Scholar][scholar].
