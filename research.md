I am a postdoctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Research Laboratory of Electronics) and Massachusetts General Hospital (Cardiology Division). My advisors are [Aaron Aguirre](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/10465), [Brandon Westover](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/84202), and [Collin Stultz](http://imes.mit.edu/people/faculty/stultz-collin/). We use machine learning to identify patients at high risk of adverse cardiovascular or respiratory events, and to phenotype critical illness.

I did my PhD at Georgia Tech with [Gari Clifford](http://gdclifford.info/people/gari), [Shamim Nemati](http://nematilab.info/people/shamim/index.html), and [Amit Shah](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#AJSHAH3). We extracted features from heart rate and accelerometer data using signal processing, estimated illness from these features with machine learning, and improved performance by analyzing information during specific times, over several time scales, and between signals. Application areas included sepsis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, mental illness, and neurodegeneration.
