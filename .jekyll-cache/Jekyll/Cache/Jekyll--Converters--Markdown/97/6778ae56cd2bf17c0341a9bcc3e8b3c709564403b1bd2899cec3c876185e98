I"Ú<p>I had the privilege of attending a masterclass on leadership at Stanford University School of Medicine with Lloyd Minor, the Dean. Hereâ€™s what we learned.</p>

<p>He suggested three readings to prepare:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/assets/masterclass_gardner.pdf">Personal renewal</a> by John Gardner.</li>
  <li><a href="/assets/masterclass_kotter.pdf">What leaders really do</a> by John Kotter.</li>
  <li><a href="/assets/masterclass_simmons.pdf">I was impossible, but then I saw how to lead</a> by Ruth Simmons.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our class had ~15 clinicians, technologists, and students. We started with introductions and then discussed five principles of leadership:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Listen &amp; learn.</li>
  <li>Diverse teams maximize performance.</li>
  <li>Empower your team<sup id="fnref:footnote1"><a href="#fn:footnote1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>Management deals with complexity, while leadership deals with change.</li>
  <li>Plan transitions<sup id="fnref:footnote2"><a href="#fn:footnote2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Dr. Minor also answered some questions from our group:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you earn loyalty, especially when you are a new leader at an established organization?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Buy-in from people you lead is dynamic and evolves over time. Listen and learn.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you build a culture where people are proud to be part of your organization?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hire people who already bought in to your vision. People at Stanford or Google <em>want</em> to be there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you do if your organization faces a threat and you have to act before getting everyoneâ€™s permission?</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Communicate the threat to your organization.</li>
  <li>Take action.</li>
  <li>Protect your organization and make it clear your actions were to do so and not to further your own interest or harm anyone you lead.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you create core values in your organization?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Core values already exist in large orgs; you donâ€™t create them. You have to listen to find, gain consensus around, clarify, and articulate them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you continue learning leadership?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read (form a group), get a coach, and obtain feedback.</p>

<hr />

<p>Emory should hold similar sessions with our Deans and Chairs to teach students and trainees more about leadership. Stay tuned, Iâ€™ll work on it.</p>

<p>And of course I had to get a picture with the boss!</p>
