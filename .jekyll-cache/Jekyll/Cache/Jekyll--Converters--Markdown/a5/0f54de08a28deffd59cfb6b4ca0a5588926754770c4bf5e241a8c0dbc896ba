I"ó<p>My team and I are excited to announce that Forge has merged with <a href="http://slinghealth.org/">Sling Health</a> (previously IDEA Labs) â€” a biomedical design and entrepreneurship incubator with chapters in St. Louis, Boston, Philadelphia, Ann Arbor, and New Orleans. Sling Health collaborates with the American Medical Association and many industry and academic sponsors. Forge is now the Atlanta chapter of Sling Health, and has adopted the latter organizationâ€™s branding and vision.</p>
