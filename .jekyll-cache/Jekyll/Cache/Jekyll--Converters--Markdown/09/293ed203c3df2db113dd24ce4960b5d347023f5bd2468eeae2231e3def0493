I"0<p>I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Cardiovascular Research Center in MGH, and the Research Laboratory for Electronics at MIT. My advisors are <a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/10465">Aaron Aguirre</a>, <a href="http://cdac.mgh.harvard.edu">Brandon Westover</a>, and <a href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/cb/">Collin Stultz</a>.</p>

<p>We develop machine &amp; deep learning approaches for several projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cardiologist-level interpretation of 12-lead ECGs</li>
  <li>Inferrence of novel labels from 12-lead ECGs</li>
  <li>Prediction of cardiac arrest or shock from ICU time series data</li>
  <li>Estimation of outcomes after cardiac surgical procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>I am also affiliated with the <a href="http://healthcaretransformation.org">Healthcare Transformation Lab</a> at MGH, which was created to improve the experience and value of health care by inspiring collaborative innovation and leveraging novel technologies.</p>

<p>I did my PhD at Georgia Tech. I worked on signal processing and machine learning applied to time series data from wearable devices. My advisors were <a href="http://gdclifford.info/people/gari">Gari Clifford</a>, <a href="http://nematilab.info/people/shamim/index.html">Shamim Nemati</a>, and <a href="https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#AJSHAH3">Amit Shah</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to my MD/PhD training, I studied Bioengineering at UCLA. I developed cellularized fibrin hydrogels for dermal wound healing, nanoparticles for imaging cells, and computational diffusion-reaction models of oxygen transport and cell growth. My advisors were Bill Tawil and Benjamin Wu.</p>

<p>My papers are available at <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=APy8nq4AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Google Scholar</a>.</p>
