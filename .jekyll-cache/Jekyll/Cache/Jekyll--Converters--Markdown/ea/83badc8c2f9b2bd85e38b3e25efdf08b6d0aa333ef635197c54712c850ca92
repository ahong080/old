I"Ú<p>In 2018 I interned at <a href="http://takedaventures.com">Takeda Ventures</a>, an early-stage venture capital firm within Takeda Pharmaceuticals. I worked with Senior Partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-shaywitz-md-phd-232a23e/">David Shaywitz, MD, PhD</a>. We evaluated investment opportunities in startups that use data science and technology to discover, assess, or deliver impactful new treatments for patients.</p>

<p>In 2014 I co-founded Forge Health, a non-profit that provided startups with funding, mentors, and assistance starting clinical pilots at Emory Healthcare and the Atlanta VA Medical Center. In 2016 Forge merged with Sling Health, a biomedical technology incubator (<a href="http://erikreinertsen.com/forge-merger-sling-health/">see blog post</a>).</p>

<p>At Emory I created an elective course for medical students on <a href="http://erikreinertsen.com/papers/iemed.pdf">Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship in Medicine</a> and ran it for two years.</p>

<p>At UCLA I founded and led a chapter of the <a href="http://www.ispeucla.com/">International Society for Pharmaceutical
Engineering</a>. We were the first organization to provide students with career opportunities in biotechnology and pharma.</p>
