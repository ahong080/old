Aetna (Emory University's student health insurance) excludes copays from the cost of medical care. In other words, copays you pay per doctor visit do not count towards your deductible. This unfriendly policy is either absent from or obfuscated within their written policy so they profit more from students.

Recently my eyes have felt dry and fatigued from staring at monitors for 14 hours a day. I sought care at the Emory Eye Center. Later, Aetna sent me documents to explain the costs. Two things concerned me.
 
First, Aetna incorrectly labeled a $181.00 exam at a specialist visit as a routine eye exam. They do not cover the latter. I called Aetna and asked them to fix this. The balance I owed (after a $150 deductible) declined from $181.00 to $4.05. Always check your bill carefully.

Second, Aetna does **not** count copays as a medical cost. In other words, your deductible does not count towards the total you must spend to meet your deductible.

This seems wrong, given how Aetna's own [glossary of terms](https://www.aetna.com/glossary.html#C) defines copay as:

> This is the dollar amount you pay for health care expenses.

and defines deductible as:

> The amount you pay for covered services before your health plan begins to pay.

Not counting copays towards your deductible raises the total amount you must spend to meet your deductible and subsequently qualify for coinsurance.

I saw the doctor once, and had to pay $175 ($25 co-pay + $150 of the original amount billed to meet my deductible). Imagine if you have to see the doctor several times. You will have to pay a $25 copay per visit, even if you already met your deductible.

Not all insurance companies do this, but Aetna does.

The Aetna employee I spoke with said:

> Aetna student health is a separate system and product than Aetna, so your copays do not count towards your deductible.

What a weak excuse.

In conclusion, Aetna does not comply with the fine print in its own plan, and enforces a copay policy unfriendly to students who visit the doctor.

Could this be a cause of action for insurance regulators, the people at Emory who oversee this plan, or a lawyer looking for a valid basis for a class action suit?
