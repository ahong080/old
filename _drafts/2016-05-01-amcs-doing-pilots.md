Here is a list of incubators, groups, initiatives, and centers at academic medical centers (AMCs) that help pilot new technologies or care delivery models[^1].

They focus on feasibility, validation, evidence generation, etc.

Also included are some sources of seed-stage project funding.

These are *not* primarily [startup / seed accelerators](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Seed_accelerato://www.wikiwand.com/en/Seed_accelerator).

To illustrate the difference: a digital health startup might receive funding and advice from [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/), but also work with one of these centers to build clinical credibility[^2].

[^1]: Some of these centers may actually be a re-branding of the CIO's sales channel. Startups trying to sell / implement to an enterprise healthcare system can be directed to the "Innovation Center".
[^2]: An ideal outcome is a peer-reviewed publication demonstrating clinical feasibility, and eventually efficacy. Omada leads by example here. Such milestones are difficult, expensive, and unfortunately underappreciated by tech investors who want to dive in and "disrupt" healthcare. Angels and VCs newly entering the healthcare space should learn more about how their colleagues in biotech operate.
